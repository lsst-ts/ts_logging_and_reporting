## Set up

For local development, create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code is formatted correctly and that notebooks are cleared of outputs before committing. To set up the pre-commit hooks, run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
