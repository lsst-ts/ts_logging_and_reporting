# Scaffolding for Times Square notebooks (thread-1)
* Parameters
- Parameters available to user via Times Square side panel.

- A schema for these is given in <notebook>.yaml in same directory.

- The defaults given here must all be string values.  Convert those to
  other types in a subsequent cell

- Include parameters that affect filtering (query) used in Source API

- Consider common parameters such as:
  + record_limit
  + num_recs_in_example
  + min_date
  + max_date



: # Parameters. Set defaults here.
: # Times Square replaces this cell with the user's parameters


* Imports and General Setup
- Setup includes conversion of parameter values to usable values
- Get "environment" (server host). e.g. https://usdf-rsp-dev.slac.stanford.edu
- Included non-user parameters:
  + timeout
  + env

* Setup Source
- Choose fields of interest.  The records (list of dict) in each field
  we need in any way. All other fields could be deleted for our
  purposes.

- Choose fields to use for extracting facets.

- Create full API URL (including query string) from parameters, etc.

- Choose fields to display to user in table. ~table_fields~
- Choose fields to display to user in plot. ~(x,y)~

* Get Records
- Usually use python "requests" package for accessing API
  But, some APIs might have their own client.

- Use try/except around requests.get() or requests.post()
  User friendly error if exception (cannot connect, etc)
  User friend error if get non-200 response status.

- Get list field names from rec[0]

- Calc facet over selected field names.

* Table of (mostly raw) results
- Display pandas table of all records using
  : df = pd.DataFrame(recs)[table_fields]

* Plot of results
- Display minimum useful (?!) plot from this Source
  Example:
  : plt.plot([r['date'] for r in recs], [r['time_lost'] for r in recs])
  : plt.show()

* Output raw content analysis (rec, fields, facets)
** Example records
** Fields found
** Facets of selected Fields
* Stakeholder Elicitation
- Source specific questions to stakeholders.
