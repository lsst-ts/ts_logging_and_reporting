### Nightly Digest FastAPI Application Added to Logging and Reporting Backend

- Introduces a FastAPI application with endpoints to retrieve data from data source adapters.
- Updates data source adapters to accept an authentication token, either forwarded by the API endpoint or obtained from environment variables or authentication headers.
- Modifies the `NarrativelogAdapter` to set the instrument in narrative log data using the `components_json` field instead of `components`.
